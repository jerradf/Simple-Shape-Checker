# Simple-Shape-Checker
Worked in collaboration with Thomas Wang at Coding Minds Academy. Good project to introduce data mining, files, algorithms and GUI.
 Using Pixel Extraction, this program checks shapes for "closeness" or "openness". 
 An "open" shape is determined by there being a pixel that does not have two adjacent pixels that are in the shape. 
 A "closed" shape is one that has two adjacent pixels that are in the shape for every pixel. 
 Acceptable images are single-pixel-lined drawings on a .jpg file.
